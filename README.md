### Hi there 👋

My name is Beatriz and I'm currently an undergraduate student in Social Sciences from Brazil. <br>
I've been learning Rprograming and Rstats since 2022 on my own to improve my analytical skills as a social scientist and as a researcher! <br>
My areas of interest include methods quantitatives, public policies and urban development. I've also colaborated on projects related to digital methods and public opinion. <br>
